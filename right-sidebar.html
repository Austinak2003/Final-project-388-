											<h2>About Me</h2>

											<p>Hello, My name is Austin Knutson and I am currently pursuing my professional writing degree at Western Illinois University. Our course work requires us to create a hardcoded website with blog posts discussing a food related subject. The company Fight for the Forgotten brought my attention to unsanitary water in third world countries several years ago. After conducting informal research in the past I thought it would be a great opportunity to write my project about the topic. </p>

											
											<h2>Accesibilty and Design Philosophy</h2>
											<p> 	When creating a website Inclusive design is important to keep in mind to ensure a friendly user experience for the consumer. Inclusive design is made up of design and accessibility, and is a concept that strives toward making the user experience first concern to ultimately make the content easily accessible to a wide variety of users(Horton & Quesenbery). There are three main strategies I will use to incorporate inclusive design in my website building process. First, I will use plain language that can be perceived by a wide range of individuals. Second, my project has a clear focus that can connect with a variety of people. Lastly, I will incorporate different forms of wayfinding to help users easily navigate to whatever part of the website they are searching for.<p>

											</p> 
												
													My project details a variety of water sanitation issues around the world and in turn has a fairly diverse audience. While creating the content for blog posts one through seven it was important for the content to come off as relatable. With this in mind my website design will feature a preview to two blog posts, and one cornerstone content post. These posts on the front page will contain clickable links that bring the reader to more information and blog posts. Overall I hope my website provides an easy flowing experience for the consumer so they can learn more about unsanitary water conditions without hassle. 
											</p>
											<h2>Abstract</h2>
											<p>This project covers a variety of water sanitation problems across the globe. The blog posts are designed to be read by someone with very little knowledge about the topic. First the post discusses water sanitation issues in developed countries, as well as underdeveloped countries. More specifically the project focuses on the consequences of consuming unsanitary water. Following this, the blogs dive into some of the current solutions to provide sanitary water to the unfortunate. Overall this project attempts to compare and contrast different water sanitation issues to bring more awareness to the problem
